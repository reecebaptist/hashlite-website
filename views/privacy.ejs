                    <p>We will take appropriate steps to delete any personal data of persons less than 13 years of age
                        that
                        has been collected on our Website without verified parental consent upon learning of the
                        existence
                        of such personal data.</p>
                    <h3>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>All information you provide us with is stored on our providers' cloud-servers in the European
                        Economic Area.</p>
                    <h3>LENGTH OF STORAGE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes for
                        which
                        we originally collected it, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
                        applicable
                        law.</p>
                    <h3>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES PRINCIPLES</h3>
                    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
                        and
                        the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection
                        laws
                        around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
                        implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
                        information.</p>
                    <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
                        action,
                        should a data breach occur:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days;</li>
                        <li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days;</li>
                        <li>When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms
                            of
                            natural persons, without undue delay.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right
                        to
                        pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
                        the
                        law.</p>
                    <p>This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
                        but
                        also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or
                        prosecute
                        non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                    <h3>SECURITY</h3>
                    <p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible weaknesses and attacks. The technologies we use
                        are
                        designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal

                        Although we
                        will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your
                        data
                        transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
                        information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized
                        access. We can only guarantee that we will do our best to keep your data safe.</p>
